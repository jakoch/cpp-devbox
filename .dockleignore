CIS-DI-0001 # Create a user for the container
# Disabled because:
# Currently user is root.
# This is a devcontainer image for usage inside VSCode or a CI pipeline.

CIS-DI-0005 # Enable Content trust for Docker
# Disabled because:
# This is open-source. Not messing around with keys and trust for now.

CIS-DI-0006 # Add HEALTHCHECK instruction to the container image
# Disabled because:
# The Docker engine itself does not automatically restart unhealthy containers
# based on HEALTHCHECK pings to the local Docker host.
# This is also not a server container with a running service,
# which needs to be kept alive.

CIS-DI-0008 # Confirm safety of setuid/setgid files
# Disabled because:
# This is a devcontainer image for usage inside VSCode or a CI pipeline.
